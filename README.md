# Holy Qu'ran Advance Search Bundle
### Project Version 2.5

## Summary

A summary of the features of the product must mention the following:

### Project Description
Holy Qur'an Advance Search bases the searching of Arabic text leveraging its extraordinary scientific etymological lexicon structure.
The roots and stems provide a way to find the word easily by providing a mechanism that can match in systemic proximity of the word, ranging from loose context to exact grammatical matching. A phenomenon with this level of perfection is lacking in all other languages. Leveraging this quality of Arabic, the system helps the user find the correct verse easily.
The searches are enhanced by the use of phonetics applicable to all three layers of Arabic and also other translations in Urdu.
This project is an entry point to the Verse Centric Holy Qur'an concept where every verse of the Holy Qur'an is cherished as a sign from Allah. All details about the verse internal and external will be provided for each verse eventually. This will also help find content on Alislam as well.
